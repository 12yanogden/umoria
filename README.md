# umoria
A wrapper for the awesome rogue-like crawler, umoria.

Also will include:
1. A calculator to maximize my pack.
2. A calculator for haggling
3. Allow for save slots
4. Automatically cache savefiles, just in case I save over a save slot accidentally.
5. Automatically archive savefiles.
6. Restore from archive or restore from cache
7. Research aimed towards maximizing character

More features might be possible if I could read the savefile such as:
- Automatic labelling of the savefiles. Display name, level, depth, etc.
- Better searching and tagging of savefiles.
